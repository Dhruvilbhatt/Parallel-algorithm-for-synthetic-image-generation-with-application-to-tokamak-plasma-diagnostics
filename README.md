# The tomographic reconstruction is a powerful diagnostic tool in nuclear fusion exper-
iments for the determination of the shape and position of the plasma. However, neural
networks are emerging as a suitable alternative to conventional plasma tomography
algorithms. In order to train such AI/ML based models, we need large-scale, diver-
sified image data for learning and evaluation which is difficult to obtain from real
experiments.
